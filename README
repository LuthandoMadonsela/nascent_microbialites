A collection of raw data, Python script and R scripts used to create data and images for manuscript entitled "Recruitment and successional progression of pioneer bacteria in nascent microbialites"

3. Figure 6: Conserved OTUs (2019 - 2022)
             Input file (Conserved_OTUs_All)

4. Figure S3: Nutrient analysis
              Input file (nutrients)

5. Python script:
The python script was used to convert counts to relative abundances per sample and extract the Top 10 OTUs from each sample across all samples. The script, taxonomy table, count table and mothur_output_prep.py file are included in the "Python_files" depository.
